Now we are going to work with multi-dimensional arrays. Have fun!

Find the smallest and largest number in <b>list1</b>
<br>

When inside a function, you make a call to the function itself, it's called <b>recursivity</b>.

<pre>
def func(i = None):
    if i is None:
        i = 1
        result = func(i)
    else:
        result = i

    return result

print(func())
</pre>

<pre>
It prints out '1'
