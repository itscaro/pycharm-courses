As you can see the trailing "|" are not well aligned, now we need to make it aligned for any multiplication table.

Note:

When you use %d, you print a variable as it is.
When you use %4d, you print a variable in a fixed-length format of 4.
When you use %04d, you print a variable in a fixed-length format of 4 with empty filled with "0".
When you use %4.2d, you print a variable in a in a fixed-length format of 4 with 2 digits after the point, the point is counted in the length.
