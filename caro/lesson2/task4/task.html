Ask the user for the file path, read the file and print it out. If the given path is not a file, ask again till the user
give a file that exists.<br>

You can open a file with the function open:
fileHandler = open([path to the file])

fileHandler.read() : to read all the content

fileHandler.seek() : to position the cursor (cursor is the position from where you read or write to the file)

When you open a file, the cursor is at the beginning of its content (index 0). When you read all the content with read()
for example, the cursor is at the end of the content. If you want to read twice the file, you need to rewind the cursor
to position 0 before reading for the second time:

<pre>
fileHandler.read()
fileHandler.seek(0)
fileHandler.read()
</pre>

To verify if a file exit you can use:

<pre>
import os.path.isfile

os.path.isfile(filename)
</pre>

<b>Do-While loop</b>
<pre>
While True:
    dosomething()
    if condition_to_break_the_loop:
        break
    else:
        # actions to do before looping
</pre>
