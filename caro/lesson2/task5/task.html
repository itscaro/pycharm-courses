In the last task, we saw:
<pre>
fileHandler = open([path to the file])
fileHandler.read()
fileHandler.close()
</pre>

In Python, you can use "with" statement which takes responsible of closing the file for you, so you do not need to explicitly
call the method close() of the file object, as following:
<pre>
with open([path to the file]) as fileHandler:
    fileHandler.read()
</pre>

It's a better practice to use "with" statement!

Read the file "console5.csv" with csv.reader() in csv package and print out:
<pre>
['Date', 'Value']
['18/01/2015', '1']
['18/02/2015', '2']
['18/03/2015', '3']
['18/04/2015', '4']
['18/05/2015', '5']
</pre>
